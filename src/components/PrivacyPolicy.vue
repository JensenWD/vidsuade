                                using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the

                                where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you,
                                or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or
                                fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
                                information from you.<br><br>
                                If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with
                                you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal

                                information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests
                                (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
